    RT 128088 Synopsis should call parse(), not parse_file(). Thanks to
    jabowery for catching this.

    Handle <th> like <td>. That is, create a {headers} key in the <tr>
    hash. This contains the <th> hashes for the row, or undef if the
    position contains a <td>. Similarly, the {cells} key contains an
    undef for a <th>. Trailing undefs in both are removed, as is the
    whole tag if it is empty.
    
    A true value for the {classic} argument to new() restores the old
    behavior. The {headers} key in the <table> hash gets populated either
    way.
